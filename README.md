# CivGen

CivGen allows users to generate basic details for a fictional civilization to be used in a Table Top Role Playing Game (TTRPG). The resources used are intentionally agnostic of any specific terrain or fictional race to allow for creative flexibility.

This is a passion project designed exclusively in Python to learn and grow my skills with the language.
